    <P>The University of Calicut, also known as Calicut University, is a state-run public university headquartered at
    Tenhipalam in Malappuram district of the state of Kerala, India. Established in 1968, it is the first university to be
    set up in northern Kerala.The University came into being as a result of the efforts of the leaders C.H. Mohammed Koya, C. Achutha Menon, and K. P.
    Kesava Menon. With the encouragement of the then Kerala Chief Minister, E.M.S. Namboodiripad, C.H. Mohammed Koya the
    then Kerala Education Minister constituted a twenty-two member committee of experts to make a pilot study on
    establishing new universities in the State.
    
    The twenty-two member Committee in its report unanimously recommended the immediate establishment of a University in
    Calicut to organize post-graduate departments of studies and research and to affiliate colleges in the northern
    districts. Before long C.H. Mohammed Koya appointed K.C. Chacko, Director of Technical Education as the special officer
    and M. Abdul Rahim, Municipal Commissioner, as administrative officer for the formation of the University at Calicut. On
    23 July 1968 C.H Mohammed Koya obtained an Ordinance on creating the University.
    
    Thus came into being the University of Calicut. K.C. Chacko, Special Officer, was appointed the first
    Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University; the University was formally inaugurated at a public function on 12 August 1968,
    the Calicut University Bill was passed by the State Legislative Assembly on 29 August 1968; and statutory bodies such as
    the Senate, Syndicate, Academic Council, Faculties and Boards of Studies were constituted.</P>
